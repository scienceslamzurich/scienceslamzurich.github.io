      <description>Murezi has been with Science Slam Zurich for about a year. Being the treasurer, he must sometimes play the role of the fun-police. As opposed to the real scientists and engineers in the team, he is still in his health science and technolgy bachelors, looking to get the degree in 2020.</description>
